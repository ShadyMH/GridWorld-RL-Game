# GridWorld-RL-Game

## Overview

**GridWorld-RL-Game** is an interactive Python-based environment designed for exploring and experimenting with reinforcement learning algorithms. The project is centered around a grid-based game where an agent is tasked with navigating a series of obstacles, collecting coins, and reaching a goal, all while avoiding capture by a patrolling police officer. The environment supports two popular reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and SARSA, allowing users to observe and compare how these algorithms perform in a dynamic and visual setting.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to learn or demonstrate the principles of reinforcement learning in a controlled, yet engaging environment.

## Features

- **Interactive Setup:**
  - Users can define and place various game elements such as goals, coins, slippery cells, walls, and clocks on the grid using a graphical interface. This allows for a highly customizable game environment tailored to specific learning scenarios.

- **Customizable Learning Environment:**
  - The grid size, number of episodes, learning rates, discount factors, and exploration rates can be adjusted to control the complexity and behavior of the agent during training.

- **Support for Q-learning and SARSA:**
  - The project provides implementations of both Q-learning and SARSA, two fundamental algorithms in reinforcement learning. Users can switch between these algorithms to observe differences in how the agent learns and adapts.

- **Real-Time Visualization:**
  - The learning process is visualized through scatter plots showing the rewards obtained across episodes, and through animated grid-based gameplay, allowing users to see the agent’s decisions and movements in real-time.

- **Challenging Gameplay with a Police Mechanic:**
  - The inclusion of a patrolling police officer adds an extra layer of difficulty, requiring the agent to not only collect rewards but also avoid capture, making the environment more challenging and realistic.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GridWorld-RL-Game.git
   cd GridWorld-RL-Game
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you do not have a `requirements.txt` file, install the necessary packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pygame matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Game:**
   - Launch the game by running the main script:
     ```bash
     python Project.py
     ```

2. **Configure Game Settings:**
   - **Grid Size:** Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 7x7).
   - **Pre-train Episodes:** Set the number of episodes the agent will use for pre-training before the actual gameplay begins.
   - **Max Steps per Episode:** Limit the maximum number of steps the agent can take in each episode.
   - **Alpha:** Set the learning rate, which controls how quickly the agent updates its knowledge.
   - **Gamma:** Define the discount factor for future rewards, which determines how much future rewards influence the current decision-making.
   - **Epsilon:** Specify the exploration rate, which controls how often the agent chooses a random action over exploiting its current knowledge.
   - **Num Coins:** Indicate the number of coins to be placed on the grid.
   - **Coin Reward:** Set the reward value for collecting each coin.
   - **Train Episodes:** Determine the number of training episodes.
   - **Algorithm:** Choose between `q_learning` and `sarsa` to train the agent.
   - **Delay:** Set the time delay (in milliseconds) between each step in the game’s animation.

3. **Place Game Elements:**
   - After configuring the settings, you will enter a placement mode where you can manually position the goal, coins, slippery cells, walls, and clocks on the grid using a graphical interface. This step is crucial as it defines the environment in which the agent will learn and operate.

4. **Start the Training:**
   - Once all elements are placed, the agent will begin its training process. The training progress can be monitored through a scatter plot, which updates in real-time to show the total reward accumulated by the agent in each episode. Additionally, the gameplay is animated, allowing you to visually follow the agent's movements and decisions on the grid.

## Project Structure

- **Project.py:** The main script that includes the core game logic, reinforcement learning algorithms, user interface for element placement, and the training loop.
- **Images Folder:** This directory contains all the images (e.g., agent, coin, goal) used in the game’s graphical interface. Ensure these images are correctly loaded for the game to display elements properly.
- **README.md:** The file you're reading now, which provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## How It Works

- **Reinforcement Learning Process:**
  - The agent begins by exploring the grid with little knowledge of the environment, balancing exploration and exploitation based on the epsilon-greedy policy. Over time, as it learns from the rewards and penalties it receives, the agent’s decisions become more informed, leading to better performance in achieving the goal while avoiding obstacles like walls and the police officer.

- **Q-Learning vs. SARSA:**
  - In Q-learning, the agent updates its knowledge based on the maximum expected future rewards, which may lead to more aggressive exploration. SARSA, on the other hand, updates its knowledge based on the action actually taken in the next state, which often results in more conservative learning. This project allows you to observe these differences in practice.
